*****SENTIMENT ANALIZATOR*****

# THERE IS A LEXICON.JS FILE INSIDE app\assets\js\includes

# LEXICON.JS FILE CONTAINS INITIAL OBJECT OF WORDS AND THEIR SENTIMENT VALUES THAT WILL BE STORED
IN LOCAL STORAGE AT FIRST LAUNCH.

# YOU CAN INSERT NEW WORDS IN LEXICON.JS FILE IN A SAME WAY AS REST OF THE WORDS

# FOR EACH WORD THERE IS A VALUE FOR THAT WORD, POSITIVE (FROM > 0 TO 1), NEGATIVE (FROM < 0 TO -1), OR NEUTRAL (JUST 0)

# ONCE LAUNCHED, APP WILL SHOW ALL LEXICON WORDS. YOU CAN EDIT THEIR VALUES AS WELL, OR DELETE THEM

# IN CALCULATOR TAB YOU CAN INSERT SOME TEXT INSIDE TEXTAREA, OR UPLOAD .TXT FILE.

# EACH WORD FROM TEXTAREA OR .TXT FILE WILL GO TROUGH LEXICON WORDS, IF WORDS ARE MATCHING,
  APP WILL CHECK IF WORD CONTAINS POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR NEUTRAL VALUE

# THEN YOU WILL GET YOUR RESULTS ABOUT THE TEXT, AND TOTAL VALUE OF THE DOCUMENT.

# THE REACHER LEXICON IS, THE BETTER AND ACCURATE RESULTS WILL BE.
